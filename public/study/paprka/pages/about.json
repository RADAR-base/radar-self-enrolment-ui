            "content": "Knee Osteoarthritis (OA) is a disease of the knee joint that causes it to lose function and work less well. It affects around 250 million in the world and around 1 in 5 people over the age of 50 in the UK.\n<br />\nPeople living with this disease tell us that it causes a lot of pain and affects how well they can walk. Having a knee replacement can help with these problems.\n<br />\nPeople having surgery want to know how long their recovery will take and when their mobility will improve.\n<br />\nThe Physical Activity Patterns after Knee Arthroplasty (PAPrKA) study, led by the University of Manchester, will answer those questions using the information and data people will share with us from their smartphones and wearable fitness devices.\n<br />\nWe want to:\n- Understand how people with knee osteoarthritis recover and get back to physical activity.\n- Understand the reasons why some people recover better than others.\n- Link the information that people share with us from their smartphones and wearables with their NHS records. This will lead to a better understanding of peopleâ€™s symptoms and experiences.\n- Share our experiences on working with people and the data they share for research.\n"

The device they used can be:\n- a smart phone application (which can be any of the following: Google Fit, Strava or Apple health)\n- a wearable (which can be any of the following: Fitbit, Apple watch, Polar, Garmin, or Oura)\n\n<br />\nPeople who can read and understand English or have support from someone who can.\n<br />\nPeople must be willing to give us permission to look at their physical activity data and the information held about their knee replacement surgery in the National Joint Registry."
